Some fields support searching on a range. This includes fields with numerical data like hp and nationalPokedexNumbers.
Search for only cards that feature the original 151 pokemon.
nationalPokedexNumbers:[1 TO 151]
Copy
Using square brackets [ and ] means to do an inclusive range search, while using curly braces { and } means exclusive.

hp:[* TO 100]
Copy
Search for cards with any HP greater than or equal to 150.
hp:[150 TO *]
Copy
Search on nested fields#
To search nested fields, use a period . as a separator. For example, to filter by the set id:
set.id:sm1
Copy
Or to filter on cards where they have an attack named "Spelunk":
attacks.name:Spelunk
Copy
Find cards that are banned in Standard.
legalities.standard:banned
Copy
Every field in the response is searchable.
Ordering Data#
You can also order data using the orderBy query parameter.
Order all cards from Sun & Moon by their number.
?orderBy=number
Copy
Order all cards from Sun & Moon by their name (ascending) and then their number (descending)
?orderBy=name,-number
Copy

Authentication
The Pokémon TCG API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Sign up for an account at the Pokémon TCG Developer Portal to get your API key for free.
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth. If you feel as though your API key has been compromised, you can generate a new key at any time.
Authentication to the API is performed via the X-Api-Key header. Provide your API key in the headers of all requests to authenticate to the Pokémon TCG API.
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail will redirect to HTTPS automatically. API requests without authentication won't fail, but your rate limits are drastically reduced.
Rate Limits
Overview#
Rate limits are enforced for all third-party applications and services. This document is an overview of the rate limits themselves, as well as how they are enforced and best practices for handling the errors returned when a rate limit is reached.
V2 Rate Limits#
Third-party application rate limits depend on your API key. By default, requests are limited to 20,000/day. If you need a higher rate limit, feel free to contact me via Discord or email and we can discuss.
If you aren’t using an API key, you are rate limited to 1000 requests a day, and a maxium of 30 per minute.
V1 (Deprecated) Rate Limits#
Third-party applications are currently throttled to 30 requests per minute. As this API continues to age, the rate limits may be updated to provide better performance to users
Rationale#
As previously mentioned, the primary goal is to provide a responsive interface for developers and users to use when accessing the Pokémon TCG data. Since each request made to the API incurs a computational cost, it’s in the best interest of both the Pokémon TCG API and its developer partners that these costs be minimized to the greatest degree possible.
Rate limiting also helps third-party developers by encouraging them to build their integrations to make economical use of API requests.
By donating to this API via Patreon or Kofi, you can help ensure that the server performance will meet your application needs.

Errors
The Pokémon TCG API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 200 range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the Pokémon TCG API servers.
HTTP Status Code Summary#
Status CodeDescription200 - OKEverything worked as expected.400 - Bad RequestThe request was unacceptable, often due to an incorrect query string parameter402 - Request FailedThe parameters were valid but the request failed.403 - ForbiddenThe user doesn't have permissions to perform the request.404 - Not FoundThe requested resource doesn't exist.429 - Too Many RequestsThe rate limit has been exceeded.500, 502, 503, 504 - Server ErrorsSomething went wrong on our end.Sample Error Response#
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Bad Request. Your request is either malformed, or is missing one or more required fields.",
    "code": 400
